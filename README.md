![Alt text](https://github.com/atasbh/demand_pred_DT/blob/main/Banner.png)

The objective of this project is to forecast the sales volume of a specific item, such as T-shirt, for the upcoming years of 2023-2024. To accomplish this task, we will utilize the Decision Trees Model. Decision Trees (DTs) are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features. A tree can be seen as a piecewise constant approximation.
